					<h3>Chicken</h3>
					<div id='content'>
						<p>Over the years, I’ve received countless requests for new chicken breast recipes, and many more for tips on how to bake chicken breasts in the oven.  Because anyone who worked with chicken breasts before know that they can be incredibly versatile, yet also incredibly finicky to work with, especially when baked in the oven.  Cook them the wrong way and you’ll end up with a dry, rubbery, tough, and flavorless disaster.  But cooked the right way?!  We’re talkin’ juicy, tender, flavorful, perfectly baked chicken breasts that you will love.</p>

					<h3>Beef</h3>
					<div id='content'>
						<p>This is where you can really get creative. We kept things simple in this recipe: just thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Feel free to swap in any of your favorite herbs (sage, parsley, oregano etc.) or use dried if you prefer. Spices like cumin or coriander seeds would be delicious as well, do what feels right to you! Just don't be shy on the flavorings, this is a big cut of meat and the more flavor, the better. We suggest 1 teaspoon salt per pound. Alliums like onions, garlic, and scallions would be delicious additions as well.</p>

					<h3>Sushi</h3>
					<div id='content'>
						<p>Since all of our favorite sushi restaurants have been closed these past three months, Barclay and I have gotten in a rhythm of making ourselves a big batch of homemade maki rolls here once a week. And I have to say — it has been so fun!  We prefer to keep things super no-frills around here, and usually just make our sushi with a few simple fillings plus a drizzle of spicy mayo.  But holy yum, these simple rolls have totally satisfied our sushi cravings during these weeks of staying at home.</p>
